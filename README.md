# PoseMod
Unity game code injector/launcher

This project is very unfinished and still in progress.

Already able to inject custom c# dlls, but no fancy menus or runtime text scripting yet

Check releases here:

# To Do
add the scripts for all core and freecam versions
add folder for injecting native dlls
add menu dll for custom menus
add runtime text scripting (command based)(legacy command system + new command system)
add runtime c# compiler
maybe add lua or js scripting
the rest
